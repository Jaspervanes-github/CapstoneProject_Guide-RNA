## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the Capstone Project GuideRNA. The goal of this project is to create a tool that can design guide RNA's for CRISPR-Cas9. The tool will be able to design guide RNA's for a given target sequence. The tool will also be able to design guide RNA's for a given target sequence and a given off-target sequence.

## Installation
To install the tool, clone the repository to your local machine. Then, run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dna
```
This will install all the required packages for the tool to run.
